# Goals

- Consistent automation for common patterns and refactors.
- One canonical place to define generation and application.
- Tool- and language-aware outputs via ChezMoi templates.
- Put the files into sensible subdirectories under `ai/{agents,rules,workflows,hooks,templates,snippets}`. Look at `ai/{rules,workflows}` for examples.
- Idempotent application.
